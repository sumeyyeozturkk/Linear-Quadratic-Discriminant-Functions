# Linear Quadratic Discriminant Functions

There are linear and quadratic discriminant classifier functions from scratch

# Question 1

Examine the data.
* The number of features, the number of classes and their probabilities P(Ci).
* Plot the data in a scatter plot using different colors for each class.
* Partition the data into training (80%) and evaluation set (20%) randomly.
* Compute the mean vector and covariance matrix for each class from the training set.

# Question 2

Assume that class-conditional densities are Normal. Design a linear discriminant classifier with a shared covariance matrix using MLE estimators. Obtain the training and evaluation accuracies. Plot a contour plot that shows the decision boundary. 

# Question 3

Design a quadratic discriminant classifier using different covariance matrices instead of a linear one. Obtain the training and evaluation accuracies. Plot a contour plot that shows the decision boundary.
